# y-over-react is distributed learning UI/UX platform made to cycle dynamic learning content through slides (and lesson packets).  Created using React & Redux (only shell right now) to eventually be hosted on a LMS (SCORM 2004), but should be viewable in any browser, tablet, or mobile device.

Could use help with:
1.) Expanding the store variables (currently only have slide #)
2.) Tie-in debugger to list "Variables" below interface
3.) I will be added an audio player (soon), but would like to tie timing events to bullets/graphic switches/additions while audio plays during that slide.  This used to be simple in Adobe Flash and now seems very complex to accomplish the same look and feel*

*Yes, I am a old Adobe/Flex dinosaur trying to master React as my chosen technology.  If you can put things into Flash-speak I will get it.

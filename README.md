# y-over-react

## Purpose:

Create an e-learning UI/UX platform to present learning content & media within a slide (lesson/module on a larger scale), using React & Redux. 

Final will be viewable in any browser, tablet, or mobile device (utilizing bootstrap/reactstrap). Lesson bullets to be imported by .xml/json and parsed per slide to go along with audio timing events or cues.

## Could use help with:
<ul>
  <li>Expanding the .store variables (currently only have slide #)</li>
  <li>Tie-in debugger to list "Variables" below interface</li>
  <li>Audio player to come, but would like to tie timing events to bullets/graphic while audio plays during that slide.  This used to be simple in Adobe Flash and now seems very complex to accomplish the same look and feel*</li>
</ul>
<small>*Yes, I am a old Adobe/Flex front-end guy , if are able to describe things into Flash-speak context I will get it much quicker.</small>
